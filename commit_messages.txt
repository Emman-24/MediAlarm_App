# MediAlarm Initial Implementation

Initial implementation of MediAlarm Android application with complete user onboarding flow. This commit includes project setup, splash screen, multi-page onboarding experience, privacy policy acceptance mechanism with persistent storage, and main navigation structure. The app now features a complete flow from initial launch through privacy acceptance to the main interface with bottom navigation for core app functionality (home, calendar, history, and settings). Navigation between screens is fully implemented with proper conditional routing based on user's privacy policy acceptance status.
